## Running RatePal Locally

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Git**: Make sure Git is installed for cloning the repository. Download it [here](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **Firebase Project**: You need to create a Firebase project to set up authentication.
4. **MongoDB Atlas**: Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and get your database credentials.

---

### Folder Structure
1. **RatePal-Client-Side-Main**: Contains the frontend code built with React.
2. **RatePal-Server-Side-Main**: Contains the backend code built with Node.js and Express.js.

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ratepal.git
cd ratepal
```

---

### Step 2: Setup Client-Side
1. Navigate to the client folder:
   ```bash
   cd RatePal-Client-Side-Main
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a file named `.env.local` in the `RatePal-Client-Side-Main` directory.
4. Add the Firebase configuration to the `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   VITE_apiKey=your_api_key
   VITE_authDomain=your_auth_domain
   VITE_projectId=your_project_id
   VITE_storageBucket=your_storage_bucket
   VITE_messagingSenderId=your_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_appId=your_app_id
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Step 3: Setup Server-Side
1. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd RatePal-Server-Side-Main
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `RatePal-Server-Side-Main` directory.
4. Add MongoDB Atlas credentials to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
   DB_USERPASS=your_db_password
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

---

### Step 4: Update API URL in Client-Side
1. Ensure the API URL in the client-side code points to the running server. Update the API base URL in the appropriate configuration file.

---

### Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env.local` and `.env` files are added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental uploads of sensitive credentials.
- **Firebase Rules**: Update Firebase Firestore and Realtime Database rules (if used) to match your project's requirements.
